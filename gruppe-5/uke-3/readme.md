# Week 3

This week we did some quick repetition of pointers, a slightly longer repetition of heap allocation and then an introduction of structs. You were also asked to start working on an implementation of a linked list.  

## Pointers
This code also shows how you can use casting to change the assigned value type of a variable.  

## Memory
This gives a simple repetition of heap allocation. A function that gives the square of a received value is implemented. Note that this function only returns the relevant address on the heap. Also note that the function would work without heap allocation, but then it would have to return the actual value, and not a memory address. This means that the return value have to be copied every time the function is called.  

## Structs
This code shows how you can set up a struct. Note that there is a difference between declaring a struct and declaring a struct pointer. It also shows how you can use 'typedef' to not have to write out struct 'variable name' for every reference.  

## Linked list
I have not provided any meaningful code. This is an exercise I think is very helpful, both to improve your own C comprehension, but also because the data structure is often needed in larger assignments you might be given in C, both in this course and in later courses.
