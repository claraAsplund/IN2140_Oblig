## Week 1

The code for this weeks gives an introduction to basic C syntax, value types, arrays and pointers.

### Value types
This is code to demonstrate that different types are given different sizes of allocated memory.  

### Arrays
This code shows different ways of allocating an array of a type. It also shows that a string is just an array of chars.  
### Pointers
This code demonstrates how you can use a pointer. It gives you a function that can edit values stored on specific memory addresses.  
Notice how \* is used both for declaring pointers (that holds the address of a specified value type) and dereferencing the pointer, which means you go to what is stored on the address instead of getting the address itself.  
Also notice how '&' is used to get the address of a variable.
