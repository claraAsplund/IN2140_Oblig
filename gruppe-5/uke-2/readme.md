# Week 2

This weeks code is a quiz for reviewing pointer comprehension, an introduction to allocating memory on the heap and some string comprehension.  

### Quiz
The quiz starts with some basic C syntax, before moving on to some pointer problems.

### Allocation
alloc.c shows how and why you would want to allocate space on the heap. Together with this code, it is usedul to look at how Valgrind is used to check for memory leaks. Meaning allocated memory on the heap that is not freed in the code.  

### String
This shows some basic string operations, and a suggestion on how you can implement your own version of the function strlen().  
Please note and reflect on why strnlen() is safer to use than strlen().
